1. `G7`Oh **Danny** `C`Boy, the _pipes_, the ``C7``pipes are `F`calling
From [glen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen) to `C`glen, and `Em`down the `F`mountain `G7`side
The summer’s `C`gone, and all the ``C7``flowers are `F`dying
_‘Tis you, **’tis `C`you must** `Dm`go and `G7`I must `C`bide._

> `G7`But come ye `Am`back when `F`summer’s `G7`in the `C`meadow
Or when the `Am`valley’s `F`hushed and `Em`white with `D7`snow `G7`
‘Tis I’ll be `C`here in `F`sunshine or in `C`sha`Am`dow.
Oh Danny `C`Boy, oh Danny `F`Boy, I `G7`love you `C`so.

### Second verse
And if you come, ![pipe](pipe.jpg "right")
when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead,
As dead I well may be
You’ll come and find
The place where I am lying
And kneel and say ![box](box.png) an ”Ave” there for me.

>> And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be 
---
If you’ll not fail to tell me that you love me
I’ll sleep in peace until you come to me.
