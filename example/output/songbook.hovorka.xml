1.
[G7]Oh Danny [C]Boy, the pipes, the [C7]pipes are [F]calling
From glen to [C]glen, and [Em]down the [F]mountain [G7]side
The summer’s [C]gone, and all the [C7]flowers are [F]dying
Tis you, tis [C]you must [Dm]go and [G7]I must [C]bide.

R1:
[G7]But come ye [Am]back when [F]summer’s [G7]in the [C]meadow
Or when the [Am]valley’s [F]hushed and [Em]white with [D7]snow [G7]
Tis I’ll be [C]here in [F]sunshine or in [C]sha[Am]dow.
Oh Danny [C]Boy, oh Danny [F]Boy, I [G7]love you [C]so.

2.
And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You’ll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an “Ave” there for me.

R2:
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
If you’ll not fail to tell me that you love me
I’ll sleep in peace until you come to me.

1.
[G]I wish I was in London
Or some other seaport [D]town
[D]I’d step my foot on a steamboat
And sail the ocean [G]round

2.
While sailing round the ocean
While sailing round the sea
I’d think of Handsome Molly
Wherever she may be

3.
I went to church last Sunday
She passed me on by
I knew her mind was changing
By the roving of her eye

4.
Her hair as black as a Raven’s
Her eyes were black as coal
Her teeth just like lilies
Out in the morning cold

5.
Now do you remember Molly
When you gave me your right hand
Said if you ever married
Then I’d be the man

6.
Now you’ve broke your promise
Go marry whom you please
My heart is broken
‘Til I get some ease

1.
As [C]I was a goin’ over
The [Am]far famed Kerry mountains
I [F]met with Captain Farrell and his
[C]Money he was counting
[C]I first produced my pistol
And I [Am] then produced my rapier
Saying [F] “Stand and deliver,
For [C]you are a bold deceiver!”

R:
Mush-a [G]ring dum-a do dum-a da
[C]Whack for me daddy-o
[F]Whack for me daddy-o
There’s [C]whiskey [G]in the [C]jar

2.
I counted out his money
And it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket
And I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore
That she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women
For they never can be easy

R:

3.
I went up to my chamber
All for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels
And for sure ’t was no wonder
But Jenny drew me charges
And she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell
To be ready for the slaughter

R:

4.
‘Twas early in the morning
Just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen
And likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol
For she stole away me rapier
I couldn’t shoot the water
So a prisoner I was taken

R:

1.
O the [G]summer [C]time [G]has come
And the [C]trees are sweetly [G]bloomin’
And the [C]wild [G]mountain [Em]thyme
Grows [C]around the [Am]bloomin’ [C]heather
Will ye [G]go [C]lassie [G]go?

R:
And we’ll [C]all go [G]together to pull [C]wild [G]mountain [Em]thyme
All [C]around the [Am]bloomin’ [C]heather, will ye [G]go [C]lassie [G]go?

2.
I will build my love a bower
By yon cool crystal fountain 
And round it I will pile
All the wild flowers o’ the mountain.
Will ye go lassie go?
R:

3.
I will range through the wilds
And the deep glen sae dreamy
And return wi’ their spoils
Tae the bower o’ my dearie.
Will ye go lassie go?
R:

4.
If my true love she’ll not come
Then I’ll surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin’ heather.
Will ye go lassie go?
R:
