# Whiskey in the Jar
## Irish traditional

1. As `C`I was a goin' over
The `Am`far famed Kerry mountains
I `F`met with Captain Farrell and his
`C`Money he was counting
`C`I first produced my pistol
And I `Am` then produced my rapier
Saying `F` "Stand and deliver,
For `C`you are a bold deceiver!"

> Mush-a `G`ring dum-a do dum-a da
`C`Whack for me daddy-o
`F`Whack for me daddy-o
There's `C`whiskey `G`in the `C`jar

2. I counted out his money
And it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket
And I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore
That she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women
For they never can be easy
!>

3. I went up to my chamber
All for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels
And for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny drew me charges
And she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell
To be ready for the slaughter
!>

4. 'Twas early in the morning
Just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen
And likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol
For she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water
So a prisoner I was taken
