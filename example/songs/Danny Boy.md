# Danny Boy
## English ballad

1. `G7`Oh Danny `C`Boy, the pipes, the ``C7``pipes are `F`calling
From glen to `C`glen, and `Em`down the `F`mountain `G7`side
The summer’s `C`gone, and all the ``C7``flowers are `F`dying
‘Tis you, ’tis `C`you must `Dm`go and `G7`I must `C`bide.

> `G7`But come ye `Am`back when `F`summer’s `G7`in the `C`meadow
Or when the `Am`valley’s `F`hushed and `Em`white with `D7`snow `G7`
‘Tis I’ll be `C`here in `F`sunshine or in `C`sha`Am`dow.
Oh Danny `C`Boy, oh Danny `F`Boy, I `G7`love you `C`so.

2. And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You’ll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ”Ave”  there for me.

>> And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be 
If you’ll not fail to tell me that you love me
I’ll sleep in peace until you come to me.
