1. `Am`Yippie yea `C`oh! ![horses](./horses.jpg) Yippie yea `Am`yay!

&nbsp;

>> And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
If you’ll not fail to tell me that you love me
I’ll sleep in peace until you come to me.

2. I will build my love a bower
By yon cool crystal fountain ![thyme](thyme.png "right")
And round it I will pile
All the wild flowers o' the mountain.
Will ye go lassie go? !>

3. I will range through the wilds
And the deep glen sae dreamy
And return wi' their spoils
Tae the bower o' my dearie.
Will ye go lassie go? !>

4. If my true love she'll not come
Then I'll surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather.
Will ye go lassie go? !>
