## Irish & Scottish traditional

1. O the `G`summer `C`time `G`has come
And the `C`trees are sweetly `G`bloomin'
And the `C`wild `G`mountain `Em`thyme
Grows `C`around the `Am`bloomin' `C`heather
Will ye `G`go `C`lassie `G`go?

All `C`around the `Am`bloomin' `C`heather, will ye `G`go `C`lassie `G`go?

Will ye go lassie go? !>
